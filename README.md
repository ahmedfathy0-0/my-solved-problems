# 🧩 Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **Problem Solving Repository**! 🚀 This repository is a collection of coding challenges and problems that I've solved across various platforms and languages. It's organized to help me track my progress, share solutions, and potentially assist others who are working on similar challenges.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by:

- **Languages**: Each programming language has its own folder. This helps in keeping solutions for each language separate and easy to find.
- **Platforms**: Within each language folder, you'll find subfolders for each platform from which I source the problems (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, etc.).


## 🎯 Purpose

The main purposes of this repository are:
- **Practice**: Improving my problem-solving skills by tackling challenges in different languages.
- **Organization**: Keeping my solutions well-organized for future reference.
- **Sharing**: Providing solutions that might help others in their learning journey.

## 🛠️ How to Use

- **Browse**: Explore the folders to find solutions in the language or platform of your choice.
- **Learn**: Use the solutions as a reference to understand different approaches to solving problems.
- **Contribute**: Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements or adding new solutions!

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is constantly being updated as I solve more problems. Stay tuned for more solutions and improvements!
